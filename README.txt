README 

TSECfire is a two-step, error-correcting machine learning framework designed to quantify and predict wildfire drivers in boreal peatlands. This framework, as detailed in the accompanying paper "TSECfire v1.0: Quantifying Wildfire Drivers and Predictability in Boreal Peatlands Using a Two-Step Error-Correcting Machine Learning Framework," offers a novel approach to improving the predictability of fire occurrences and sizes by addressing common errors and biases inherent in predictive modeling.


### Prerequisites

install the software and packages listed in the requirements.txt


### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

	git clone https://github.com/tangryun/GMD.git
	cd GMD
	pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running scripts

This is a simple example of running a simulation. To run different simulations, the settings should be changed in scripts case by case. 

	cd GMD/

	# run the classification step
	python classification_demo.py
	
	# run the regression step
	python regression_demo.py
